# University Assignments

This repo contains all the assignments I've had to work on for university over the course of two years. For legal reasons, the actual
assignments will not be published but a brief description of what the programs should do will be included at the top of each assignment.

The code has been adjusted to fit the criteria for submission to a program from the university that tests the student's codes. In light of
this, some formal adaptations  have been made to the code. These include:
    - naming inconsistencies, i.e., german/english or certain variable names that were pre-determined
    - strucutural adaptations, i.e., some assignments specifically required us to use functions and not classes and vice versa

Prior to this course I have had no coding experience what so ever, apart from the typcal first execise ('Hello, World!') on the
 'exercism.io' webisite.

The test functions were not provided to us. Luckily, someone amazing introduced me to TDD (Test Driven Development) very early on.

Since there were specific formalities to respect to pass the assignments, I, at times, was having a hard time writing tests at the very beginning.
This is why some assignments do not have tests files.

Disclaimer: Please do not copy these codes if you are doing this course in another semester. I have gotten permission to share my codes online
but if you could find this, chances are the tutors of your semester can too and you might end up having to repeat the course :)
